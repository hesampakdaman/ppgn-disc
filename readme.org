* Updating the generator in PPGN-h with gradients flowing through the encoder

In this master's thesis we explore the possibility of connecting discriminators at different layers of the encoder, using the /Plug & Play generative network: Conditional Iterative Generation of Images in Latent Space/ by A. Nguyen et. al<sup>1</sup>
